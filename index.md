# Debian Packaging Mentor

**Debian Packaging Mentor** is an interactive AI assistant that helps developers
create, review, and improve Debian packages following Debian Policy and
maintainer best practices.

It acts like a friendly Debian mentor - guiding you through the packaging
workflow from the first `debian/` directory to a package that is suitable for
sponsorship review.

## Key Features

- Assists with Debian packaging structure (`debian/` files)
- Explains Debian Policy in clear, practical terms
- Helps interpret and resolve `lintian` messages
- Suggests improvements aligned with maintainer best practices
- Works with multiple build systems (CMake, Meson, Autotools, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Acts as a learning tool for new contributors

---

## Who This Is For

- Developers new to Debian packaging  
- Debian maintainers reviewing packages  
- Upstream authors preparing Debian packages  
- Anyone learning Debian Policy and packaging workflows  

---

## Important Notes

- This is **not an official Debian project**
- It does **not replace sponsor or mentor review**
- Debian Policy remains the final authority

The goal is to help you learn - not automate Debian responsibility 🙂
