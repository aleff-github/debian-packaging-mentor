# Debian Packaging Mentor

Debian Packaging Mentor is an interactive AI assistant designed to help developers
create, review, and improve Debian packages following Debian Policy and
maintainer best practices.

It guides you through the full packaging workflow - from the first `debian/`
directory to a package that is suitable for sponsorship review.
